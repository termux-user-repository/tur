Burp Suite Professional Terms & Conditions of Supply

IMPORTANT NOTICE: PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS BEFORE ORDERING OR DOWNLOADING ANY SOFTWARE FROM THIS WEBSITE AS APPLICABLE TO THE LICENCE AND USE OF THAT SOFTWARE.

These Burp Suite Professional Terms & Conditions of Supply together with the documents referred to in it ("Terms") constitute the terms and conditions on which PortSwigger Ltd ("Licensor") will grant to any purchaser or user ("Licensee") a licence to use the software comprising Burp Suite Professional ("Burp Suite Professional" or the "Software"), following acceptance of an order as detailed below.

The following expressly form part of the Terms:

- The Burp Suite Professional Licence Agreement;

- The General Terms and Conditions;

- The Data Processing Agreement;

- The Privacy Policy; and

- Any other documents referred to in the above.

The Terms apply to the exclusion of any other terms that the Licensee seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.

1. Licences to Burp Suite Professional are available for purchase via the Licensor's website at https://portswigger.net/buy.

2. Placing an order for Burp Suite Professional or checking "I have read and accept the terms and conditions" on a webform is an offer by the Licensee to purchase a licence to the Software and does not constitute a contract until such time as the Licensor issues an email or web confirmation that the order is accepted by PortSwigger Ltd.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, by installing the Software the Licensee affirms that it agrees to the terms of the License and the Burp Suite Professional terms and conditions of supply, which bind the Licensee and its employees.  The contract will only relate to the Software the Licensee has licensed, as set out in that confirmation or accepted by installing it.  Notwithstanding any other communications between the parties, ordering and/or downloading the Software by the Licensee, or the download of the Software by another party at the instigation of the Licensee, shall constitute conclusive evidence that the Licensee has purchased the Software on the basis of these Terms & Conditions of Supply and PortSwigger Ltd's order quotation.

3. Unless PortSwigger Ltd has pre-approved the Licensee's purchase on credit in writing (and subject to any additional credit terms that apply to any such approval), payment is required in advance. Shortly after the Licensee makes payment and the order has been accepted by PortSwigger Ltd, the Licensee will receive an email containing instructions enabling the Licensee to log in and download the Licensee's software and licence key.  If the Licensee does not receive this email within 30 minutes of making payment, please email the Licensor, who will investigate the issue and endeavour to respond within one working day. In relation to purchases made on agreed credit terms, PortSwigger reserves the right to charge interest under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 on invoiced amounts unpaid by their due date.

4. If the Licensee's license is subject to auto-renewal and the Licensee has provided a valid recurring payment method, then payment will be taken 14 days before the expiry of the then current Licence Period (as defined in the Burp Suite Professional Licence Agreement) ("Renewal Payment Date"). Auto-renewal for specific licences can be disabled on the Licensee's account page.

5. If the Licensee wishes to cancel its order, please email the Licensor, within 7 days of making payment or payment being taken for auto-renewal licenses, or if the order has been placed on credit, credit having been pre-approved by PortSwigger Ltd, please email the Licensor within 7 days of placing the order, and in each case before the Licensee downloads the software or licence key.  If the Licensee already downloaded the software or licence key, it will not be possible to refund the order.

6. If the Licensee's payment is subject to any tax liability within any jurisdiction (for example, withholding tax) then it bears sole responsibility for meeting this liability, and no deductions must be made in the amount paid to PortSwigger Ltd.  PortSwigger Ltd does not accept liability for any tax liabilities that may arise from the Licensee's purchase of the Software or any associated services hereunder.

7. When the contract for the purchase of Burp Suite Professional has been concluded, such contract is made for the benefit of the Licensee and PortSwigger Ltd only and is not intended to benefit, or be enforceable by, anyone else.

8. These Terms (including all the documents referred to in them) are governed by and construed in accordance with English Law and submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

2. SUPPORT AND UPGRADES

2.1. The downloading of a licence for the Software entitles the Licensee to free product support provided via the Licensor's support centre portal on its website at the Licensor's sole discretion.  Such support will be subject to any support conditions, guidance or FAQs on https://support.portswigger.net/ from time to time.

2.2. If licences to new releases of the Software are offered for sale to the Licensor's customers generally, these may be made available free of charge to the Licensee for the duration of the Licence provided that the Licensee enters into a new licence agreement in respect of such new release on such terms as may be notified to the Licensee by the Licensor at that time.  If no such new licence terms are notified, these terms shall continue to apply.

3. BURP COLLABORATOR

3.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Collaborator which is a component of the Software's automated and manual testing tools available in respect of the Burp Suite Enterprise Edition and Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 3 shall only apply in respect of that Software.  Burp Collaborator involves the Licensee deploying a system on the public web (the "Collaborator Server") which acts as the recipient of third-system interactions that may be triggered by payloads that the Software sends to target systems enabling the detection of certain types of vulnerability.  A full description of the functionality of Burp Collaborator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.

3.2. The functionality of Burp Collaborator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the Licensee as fully set out in the Documentation.  By utilising any features of the Software that may cause interaction with Burp Collaborator, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality and the alternative methods of utilisation of Burp Collaborator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and as a result of such consideration has decided that Burp Collaborator, in the form utilised by it, is suitable and appropriate for use by it.  The Licensor considers Burp Collaborator to be efficacious in identifying vulnerabilities of the target website in connection with third-system interactions, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before using the Collaborator Server in any of the alternative manners set out in the Documentation.

3.3. If the Licensee is permitted by the Licensor to use the Burp Collaborator server as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by doing so the Licensee warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended the client to use the Burp Collaborator server in accordance with the terms of the Documentation and the client has instructed the Licensee to use the same having discussed with the Licensee the contents of the Documentation relating thereto.

3.4. The Licensee acknowledges and accepts that by utilising the Burp Collaborator server either on its own behalf or on behalf of a client pursuant to a bespoke consultancy, the Licensor could be a Sub-Processor of its client's personal data under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).  If the Licensor does act as a Sub-Processor, it shall handle the Licensee or the Licensee's client's data in accordance with its Privacy Notice and as set out in the Documentation relating to Burp Collaborator.

4. BURP INFILTRATOR

4.1. The Licensor has developed Burp Infiltrator which is a component of the Software for instrumenting deployed applications in order to facilitate testing using the Software in respect of the Burp Suite Enterprise Edition Burp Suite Professional Software and the terms of this section 4 shall only apply in respect of that Software.  Burp Infiltrator involves the Licensee deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator component within the target system which enhances the ability of the Software to detect certain types of vulnerability.  A full description of the functionality of Burp Infiltrator forms part of the Documentation if it applies to the version of the Software the Licensee has downloaded.

4.2. The functionality of Burp Infiltrator gives rise to issues that require careful consideration by the user as fully set out in the Documentation.  By deploying or procuring deployment of the Infiltrator tool, the Licensee will be deemed to have read the relevant Documentation, fully understood the functionality of Burp Infiltrator and considered the consequences of utilisation for its organisation and any bespoke consultancy clients of the Licensee and, as a result of such consideration, has decided that Burp Infiltrator is suitable and appropriate for use by it and by any client of the Licensee.  The Licensor considers Burp Infiltrator to be efficacious in helping to identify vulnerabilities of the target website, but the Licensee must make its own evaluation before utilising Burp Infiltrator in the manner set out in the Documentation.

4.3. If the Licensee causes its client to install Burp Infiltrator as part of a bespoke consultancy permitted under the terms of the Licence, by so doing it warrants to the Licensor that it has recommended to the client to install Burp Infiltrator on its system and has discussed with the client the contents of the Documentation relating thereto and the potential consequences of such installation.

5. EXTENSIONS

5.1. In the Licence Agreement, "Extension" means all programming additions made by a Licensee or on his behalf or with his concurrence to the Software using the Burp Extender API (as hereinafter defined) to either:

5.1.1. extend the functionality of the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor; or

5.1.2. enable the Software or any other software produced by the Licensor to inter-operate with other software;

but not to copy, clone, reproduce or emulate any existing feature of any software produced by the Licensor; and "Burp App" or "BApp" means an Extension adopted by the Licensor pursuant to this clause.

5.2 "Burp Extender API" means the official Burp Extender application programming interface made available by PortSwigger Ltd and further described as part of the Documentation.

5.3. Extensions may be created for the use of the Licensee provided that if any such Extension is published (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include sharing such Extension with another licensee or a third party unless the party to which the Extension is provided is either a client of the Licensee and the relevant Extension has been created for use on an engagement for that or another client of the Licensee, or another Licensee within the Licensee's organisation) the Licensee shall notify the Licensor and provide to it a copy of such Extension and the Licensee agrees that any such Extension shall, at the option of the Licensor, become either:

5.3.1. a Burp App; or

5.3.2. part of the Software.

5.4. When the creation of an Extension is notified to the Licensor or shared publicly and comes to the attention of the Licensor the Licensor has the option, in its sole discretion, to make the Extension a Burp App (Burp App, or BApp) after having carried out such diligence as it deems appropriate, on the Extension.

5.5. The Licensor has established the BApp Store product feature where Burp Apps are described and may be downloaded without charge for use as an Extension.

5.6. All Extensions and Burp Apps remain the property of the author but by creating such Extension, the author has granted an irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive licence free of charge to the Licensor to incorporate such Extension in the Software and to use, copy, modify and adapt it for any purpose at the Licensor's option and an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive licence to use the Extension free of charge to all third party licensees who download the Burp App from the BApp Store.

5.7. If, at the sole option of the Licensor, the Licensor incorporates an Extension into the Software a notice will be placed on the BApp Store to that effect.

5.8. The Licensor retains the right, without incurring any liability to the Licensee, to disable without notice any Burp App being used by the Licensee where the Licensor considers in its sole discretion that it is necessary to do so for operational, security or quality reasons.

6. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The Software may make use of third party technology that is provided with the Software.  The Licensor may provide certain notices to the Licensee in the Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection with such third party technology.  Third party technology will be licensed to the Licensee either under the terms of this License or, if specified in the Documentation, readmes or notice files, under separate terms or as otherwise notified to the Licensor by the Licensee.

7. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

7.1. The Licensee acknowledges that all intellectual property rights in the Software and the Documentation anywhere in the world belong to the Licensor, that rights in the Software are licensed (not sold) to the Licensee, and that the Licensee has no rights in, or to, the Software or the Documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of the Licence.

7.2. The Licensee acknowledges that it has no right to have access to the Software in source code form.

7.3. The integrity of this Software is protected by technical protection measures ("TPM") so that the intellectual property rights, including copyright, in the Software of the Licensor are not misappropriated.  The Licensee must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such TPM, nor apply or manufacture for sale or hire, import, distribute, sell or let for hire, offer or expose for sale or hire, advertise for sale or hire or have in its possession for private or commercial purposes any means the sole intended purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention of such TPM.

7.4. The Licensor will defend Licensee against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Licensee by a third party alleging that any Software or services infringe or misappropriate such third party's intellectual property rights (a "Third Party IPR Claim"), and will indemnify Licensee from any direct damages, finally awarded against Licensee as a result of, or for amounts paid by Licensee under a settlement approved by Licensor in writing of, a Third Party IPR Claim, provided that, in each case the Licensee:

7.4.1. promptly gives Licensor written notice of the Third Party IPR Claim;

7.4.2. gives the Licensor, at its sole option, the sole control of the defence and settlement of the Third Party IPR Claim; and

7.4.3. gives Licensor all reasonable assistance, at Licensor's expense.

If Licensor receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to the Software or services, Licensor may in its discretion and at no cost to Licensee (i) modify the Software or services so that they are no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, (ii) obtain a license for Licensee's continued use of the Software or services in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate Licensee's subscriptions for such Software or services upon 30 days' written notice and refund Licensee any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the terminated licence.  The above defence and indemnification obligations do not apply if (1) the allegation does not state with specificity that the Software or services are the basis of the Third Party Claim; (2) a Third Party Claim arises from the use or combination of the Software or services or any part thereof with software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by Licensor, if the Software or Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination; (3) a Third Party Claim arises from Software or services for which there is no charge or has been provided on a free trial or community licence basis; or (4) a Third Party Claim arises from the Licensee's or a third party's materials or application or Licensee's breach of this Agreement.  This clause provides the Licensor's sole liability to, and the Licensee's exclusive remedy against, the Licensor for any Third Party IPR Claim.

8. LICENSOR'S WARRANTY

8.1. The Licensor warrants that for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase of the Software (Warranty Period) the Software will, when properly used, perform substantially in accordance with the functions described in the Documentation (provided that the Software is properly used on the computer and with the runtime environment for which it was designed as referred to in the Documentation).  Burp Apps do not have the benefit of this warranty and the warranty in relation to Burp Collaborator is limited as set out in the Documentation as it relates to Burp Collaborator.  This clause 8.1 does not apply in respect of Software for which there is no charge or has been provided on a free trial or community licence basis.

8.2. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software and the Burp Apps are provided "as is" and have not been developed to meet its individual requirements, and that it is therefore the Licensee's responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software as described in the Documentation and the facilities and functions of any Burp App meet its requirements.

8.3. The Licensee acknowledges that the Software and the Burp Apps may not be free of bugs or errors, and agree that the existence of minor errors shall not constitute a breach of the Licence.

8.4. If, within the Warranty Period, the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing of any defect or fault in the Software in consequence of which it fails to perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation, and such defect or fault does not result from the Licensee having amended the Software or used it in contravention of the terms of the Licence, the Licensor will, at its sole option, either repair or replace the Software, provided that the Licensee make available all the information that may be necessary to help the Licensor to remedy the defect or fault, including sufficient information to enable the Licensor to recreate the defect or fault.

9. LICENSOR'S LIABILITY: ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CONDITION
