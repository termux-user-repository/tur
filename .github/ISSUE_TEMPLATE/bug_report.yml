        This is a bug tracker of the termux-user-repository packages. Use search to check whether your issue has been already reported and perhaps solved.
        
        To submit a bug report, fill the form below. Provide as much as possible information about the encountered issue. We may request extended information such as `strace` logs if considered necessary. This will help package maintainers to understand the problem correctly and provide a solution. Make sure that your logs do not leak sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc). Be patient, do not expect that issue could get resolved immediately.

      label: Problem description
      description: |
        A clear and concise description of what the problem is. You may attach the logs, screenshots, screen video recording and whatever else that will help to understand the issue.

        Issues without proper description will be closed without solution.
